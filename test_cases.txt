To ensure the robustness and correctness of the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, we can create a series of test cases that validate various aspects of the data preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation processes. Here is a list of meaningful test cases:

### Data Preprocessing

- **Test Case 1: Data Import Validation**
  - Verify that the training and testing datasets are imported correctly by checking the dimensions and column names.

- **Test Case 2: Missing Values Handling**
  - Ensure that missing values in the `Dependents`, `Self_Employed`, and `Loan_Amount_Term` columns are correctly replaced with '0', 'No', and 360, respectively.
  - Validate that the `Credit_History` missing values are replaced based on the `Loan_Status` condition.

- **Test Case 3: Data Type Conversion**
  - Confirm that the `Credit_History` column is converted to an object type in both training and testing datasets.

- **Test Case 4: One-Hot Encoding**
  - Check that categorical columns are correctly one-hot encoded and that the resulting dataframe has the expected number of columns.

### Model Training

- **Test Case 5: Data Partitioning**
  - Validate that the data is split into training and validation sets with the correct proportions (70% training, 30% validation).

- **Test Case 6: Model Configuration**
  - Ensure that the model configurations for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are set up with the correct parameters for grid search.

### Predictions

- **Test Case 7: Model Training and Prediction**
  - Verify that each model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) is trained without errors and can make predictions on the validation set.

- **Test Case 8: Probability Threshold Application**
  - Confirm that the probability threshold is correctly applied to convert predicted probabilities into binary class predictions.

### Evaluation

- **Test Case 9: Evaluation Metrics Calculation**
  - Validate that precision, recall, F1 score, and PR-AUC are calculated correctly for each model.

- **Test Case 10: Best Model Selection**
  - Ensure that the model with the highest F1 score is correctly identified as the best model.

- **Test Case 11: Confusion Matrix Generation**
  - Verify that confusion matrices are generated correctly for each model and that they reflect the actual vs. predicted classifications.

### Visualization

- **Test Case 12: Visualization Integrity**
  - Check that all visualizations (e.g., bar plots, confusion matrices) are generated without errors and display the expected data.

By implementing these test cases, you can ensure that the code performs as expected across all stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
