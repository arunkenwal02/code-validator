To ensure the robustness and correctness of the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, we can create a series of test cases that validate various aspects of the data preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation processes. Here is a list of meaningful test cases:

### Data Preprocessing

- **Test Case 1: Data Import Validation**
  - Verify that the training and testing datasets are imported correctly by checking the dimensions and ensuring no errors occur during import.

- **Test Case 2: Missing Values Handling**
  - Ensure that missing values in the `Dependents`, `Self_Employed`, and `Loan_Amount_Term` columns are correctly replaced with '0', 'No', and 360, respectively.
  - Validate that the `Credit_History` missing values are replaced based on the `Loan_Status` condition.

- **Test Case 3: Data Type Conversion**
  - Confirm that the `Credit_History` and `Loan_Status` columns are converted to the correct data types (`object` and `int`, respectively).

- **Test Case 4: One-Hot Encoding**
  - Verify that categorical columns are correctly one-hot encoded and that the resulting dataframe has the expected number of columns.

- **Test Case 5: Data Splitting**
  - Check that the data is split into training and validation sets with the correct proportions (70% training, 30% validation).

### Model Training

- **Test Case 6: Model Configuration and Grid Search**
  - Validate that the grid search is performed with the correct parameter grid for each model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

- **Test Case 7: Best Model Selection**
  - Ensure that the model with the highest F1 score is selected as the best model.

### Predictions

- **Test Case 8: Probability Threshold Application**
  - Confirm that the probability threshold is correctly applied to convert predicted probabilities into binary predictions.

### Evaluation

- **Test Case 9: Evaluation Metrics Calculation**
  - Verify that precision, recall, F1 score, and PR-AUC are calculated correctly for each model.

- **Test Case 10: Confusion Matrix Generation**
  - Ensure that confusion matrices are generated correctly for each model and that they reflect the actual vs. predicted outcomes accurately.

### Visualization

- **Test Case 11: Visualization Integrity**
  - Validate that the visualizations (bar plots and confusion matrices) are generated without errors and display the expected data.

### General

- **Test Case 12: No Remaining Missing Values**
  - Confirm that there are no remaining missing values in the training and testing datasets after preprocessing.

- **Test Case 13: Consistency Between Training and Testing Data**
  - Ensure that the training and testing datasets have consistent columns after preprocessing and one-hot encoding.

By implementing these test cases, you can ensure that the data preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation processes are functioning correctly and producing reliable results.
