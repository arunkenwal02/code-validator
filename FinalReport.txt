    <h2>1. Validation Metrics</h2>
    <p>The model evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC. The strengths of the model are evident in its high precision and recall, indicating effective identification of relevant instances. However, the absence of PR-AUC in the code, as mentioned in the white paper, suggests a potential area for improvement in evaluating the model's performance across different thresholds.</p>

    <h2>2. Code Comparison Inferences</h2>
    <p>The implemented code functionalities show several discrepancies when compared to the white paper's goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Choice:</strong> The white paper suggests using logistic regression, while the code implements an XGBoost model.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The code includes one-hot encoding and column type changes, which are not explicitly mentioned in the white paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Imbalance Handling:</strong> The white paper outlines methods like class weighting and SMOTE, which are not present in the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> The code omits several features listed in the white paper, such as ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation Metrics:</strong> The code lacks PR-AUC, which is highlighted in the white paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Fallback Mechanism:</strong> The white paper describes human oversight, which is not implemented in the code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, the code reflects a shift towards a more complex model with different preprocessing and evaluation strategies, but it diverges from the white paper's original framework.</p>

    <h2>3. Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model Alignment:</strong> Consider aligning the model choice with the white paper's logistic regression or update the white paper to reflect the use of XGBoost.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing Consistency:</strong> Ensure that data preprocessing steps in the code are documented and justified in the white paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Imbalance Handling:</strong> Implement imbalance handling techniques such as SMOTE or class weighting as described in the white paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Inclusion:</strong> Re-evaluate the feature selection process to include all relevant features mentioned in the white paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Metric Evaluation:</strong> Incorporate PR-AUC in the code to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Fallback Mechanism:</strong> Develop a fallback mechanism involving human oversight for uncertain cases, as suggested in the white paper.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These recommendations aim to enhance the model's accuracy, consistency, and robustness, ensuring alignment with the project's documented objectives.</p>
