To ensure the robustness and correctness of the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, we can create a series of test cases that validate various aspects of the data preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation processes. Here is a list of meaningful test cases:

### Data Preprocessing

- **Test Case 1: Data Import Validation**
  - Verify that the training and testing datasets are imported correctly by checking the dimensions and ensuring no errors occur during import.

- **Test Case 2: Missing Values Handling**
  - Ensure that missing values in the `Dependents`, `Self_Employed`, and `Loan_Amount_Term` columns are correctly replaced with '0', 'No', and 360, respectively.
  - Validate that the `Credit_History` column's missing values are replaced based on the `Loan_Status` condition.

- **Test Case 3: Data Type Conversion**
  - Confirm that the `Credit_History` column is converted to an object type and `Loan_Status` to an integer type in the training dataset.

- **Test Case 4: One-Hot Encoding**
  - Verify that categorical columns are correctly one-hot encoded and that the resulting dataframe has the expected number of columns.

- **Test Case 5: Data Concatenation**
  - Check that the training and testing datasets are concatenated correctly and that the `Loan_ID` column is dropped.

### Model Training

- **Test Case 6: Data Partitioning**
  - Validate that the training data is split into training and validation sets with the correct proportions (70% training, 30% validation).

- **Test Case 7: Model Configuration**
  - Ensure that the model configurations for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are set up correctly with the specified hyperparameters.

### Predictions

- **Test Case 8: Model Predictions**
  - Verify that each model can make predictions on the validation set without errors and that the predictions are in the expected format (binary classification).

- **Test Case 9: Probability Threshold Application**
  - Confirm that the probability threshold is applied correctly to convert predicted probabilities into binary class predictions.

### Evaluation

- **Test Case 10: Evaluation Metrics Calculation**
  - Validate that precision, recall, F1 score, and PR-AUC are calculated correctly for each model.

- **Test Case 11: Best Model Selection**
  - Ensure that the model with the highest F1 score is correctly identified as the best model.

- **Test Case 12: Confusion Matrix Generation**
  - Verify that confusion matrices are generated correctly for each model and that they reflect the actual vs. predicted classifications.

### Visualization

- **Test Case 13: Visualization Integrity**
  - Confirm that all visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar plots, density plots) are generated without errors and display the expected data.

- **Test Case 14: Graphviz Diagrams**
  - Ensure that the Graphviz diagrams for the data processing flow and random forest structure are generated and displayed correctly.

By executing these test cases, we can ensure that the code performs as expected across all stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
