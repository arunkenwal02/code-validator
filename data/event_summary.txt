This is Push code summary differenc 
 The code changes include a comprehensive update to the `requirements.txt` file, with numerous new dependencies added such as `GitPython`, `Jinja2`, `PyMuPDF`, `SQLAlchemy`, `aiofiles`, `fastapi`, and many more, while several others like `appnope`, `argon2-cffi`, `bleach`, `debugpy`, and various `jupyter` packages have been removed. This indicates a significant shift in the project's dependency requirements, likely to support new features or architectural changes.

In `main.py`, several imports have been added or reordered, including `os`, `nbformat`, `OpenAI`, and others. The initialization of a `chromadb.Client` and `OpenAIEmbeddings` is introduced, suggesting integration with a vector database and embedding models. Functions for processing PDF text and creating embeddings (`extract_from_pdf`, `create_chunks`, `create_embeddings`, `store_in_chromaDB`) have been added, indicating a new workflow for handling and analyzing document contents.

A new function, `refine_extracted_elements_with_context`, is added to refine extracted elements from a vector database based on query context, improving data processing capabilities. The main function has been significantly expanded to include steps for extracting and processing text from a PDF, creating embeddings, and querying a vector database. This indicates a new pipeline for analyzing and comparing functionalities between documents and code.

The `main.py` and `main.ipynb` files also include several changes related to the processing and comparison of functionalities between whitepapers and code, with an emphasis on extracting and refining data using embeddings and vector databases.

The `main.ipynb` file was added, containing notebook-specific code for functionality extraction and comparison, mirroring some of the changes in `main.py`.

Lastly, the `white paper.txt` file has been completely removed, indicating that its content is either outdated or incorporated into another format or system.
