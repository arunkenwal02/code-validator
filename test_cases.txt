To ensure the robustness and correctness of the code provided in the Jupyter Notebook, we can create a series of test cases that validate various aspects of the data preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation processes. Here is a list of meaningful test cases:

### Data Preprocessing

- **Test Case 1: Data Import Validation**
  - Verify that the training and testing datasets are imported correctly by checking the dimensions and column names.

- **Test Case 2: Missing Values Handling**
  - Ensure that missing values in the `Dependents`, `Self_Employed`, and `Loan_Amount_Term` columns are replaced with the specified default values.
  - Validate that the `Credit_History` column's missing values are replaced based on the `Loan_Status`.

- **Test Case 3: Data Type Conversion**
  - Confirm that the `Credit_History` and `Loan_Status` columns are converted to the correct data types (`object` and `int`, respectively).

- **Test Case 4: One-Hot Encoding**
  - Check that categorical columns are correctly one-hot encoded and that the resulting dataframe has the expected number of columns.

- **Test Case 5: Data Concatenation**
  - Validate that the training and testing datasets are concatenated correctly and that the `Loan_ID` column is dropped.

### Model Training

- **Test Case 6: Data Partitioning**
  - Verify that the data is split into training and validation sets with the correct proportions (70% training, 30% validation).

- **Test Case 7: Model Configuration**
  - Ensure that the model configurations for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are set up with the correct parameters.

### Predictions

- **Test Case 8: Model Predictions**
  - Confirm that each model can make predictions on the validation set and that the predictions are in the expected format (binary classification).

- **Test Case 9: Probability Threshold Application**
  - Validate that the probability threshold is applied correctly to convert predicted probabilities into binary outcomes.

### Evaluation

- **Test Case 10: Evaluation Metrics Calculation**
  - Verify that precision, recall, F1 score, and PR-AUC are calculated correctly for each model.

- **Test Case 11: Best Model Selection**
  - Ensure that the model with the highest F1 score is selected as the best model.

- **Test Case 12: Confusion Matrix Generation**
  - Confirm that confusion matrices are generated correctly for each model and that they reflect the actual vs. predicted outcomes accurately.

### Visualization

- **Test Case 13: Visualization Integrity**
  - Validate that the visualizations (bar plots and confusion matrices) are generated without errors and display the expected information.

By implementing these test cases, you can ensure that the data preprocessing, model training, predictions, and evaluation processes are functioning as intended and producing reliable results.
