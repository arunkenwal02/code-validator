  <h1>Objective of the White Paper</h1>
  <p>The white paper aims to describe a machine learning-based solution for optimizing loan approval workflows, focusing on modernizing the traditional process to meet digital banking demands and exploring future enhancements through alternative data sources.</p>

  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>The white paper outlines a comprehensive approach to loan approval optimization using machine learning, while the code focuses on data preprocessing, parameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.</p>

  <h2>2. Preprocessing Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Splitting Strategy:</strong> The white paper describes a 70-15-15 split for training, validation, and testing, while the code does not specify this.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> The white paper mentions one-hot encoding and normalization, whereas the code focuses on data type conversion and one-hot encoding.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Handle Imbalance Data</h2>
  <p>The white paper suggests using 'class_weight' and SMOTE for handling class imbalance, but the code does not mention these methods.</p>

  <h2>4. Feature Selection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>White Paper Features:</strong> Applicant_Income, Coapplicant_Income, Loan_Amount, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Features:</strong> Gender, Married, Dependents, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Mismatch:</strong> There is a mismatch in the features used between the white paper and the code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Model Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>White Paper Model:</strong> Logistic Regression with emphasis on recall and F1 score.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Model:</strong> Not explicitly mentioned.</li>
    <li><strong>Mismatch:</strong> The model overview in the white paper and code do not align.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Validation Metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>White Paper Metrics:</strong> Precision, Recall, F1-score, PR-AUC.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Metrics:</strong> f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, accuracy_score.</li>
    <li><strong>Mismatch:</strong> The code does not mention PR-AUC, which is emphasized in the white paper.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Hyperparameter Configuration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>White Paper:</strong> Penalty, C, Solver, Max_iter.</li>
    <li><strong>Code:</strong> eta, min_child_weight, gamma, subsample, colsample_bytree.</li>
    <li><strong>Mismatch:</strong> There is a mismatch in hyperparameter configurations between the white paper and the code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Critical Metrics</h2>
  <p>The white paper emphasizes PR-AUC due to class imbalance, which is not mentioned in the code.</p>

  <h2>9. Fallback Mechanism</h2>
  <p>The white paper mentions human oversight for high-impact decisions, but the code does not address fallback mechanisms.</p>

  <h2>10. Final Summary</h2>
  <p>There are significant mismatches between the white paper and the code. The white paper is not aligned with the code. Please update the white paper accordingly.</p>
